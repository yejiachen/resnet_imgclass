# resnet_imgclass
• Image classification using RestNet transfer learing.

• My first Kaggle competition, ranking at top 22% at Kaggle, with 95.3% Accuracy.

• Using python, keras, jupyter, nvidia 1080Ti GPU as tools and frameworks.

• As a mid-term assignment while studying/practicing artificial intelligence at AIA Taiwan (http://aiacademy.tw/).

• Due to copyright, it wasn't appropriate for me to share competition data at my own github.

• You could get access of the data from the orginal kaggle page (https://www.kaggle.com/c/aia-mid-term-exam-image-classification/data).
